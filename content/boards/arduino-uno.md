description: Details on MobiFlight support for the Arduino Uno
---

The Arduino Uno R3 is an older design that doesn't offer many IO pins and has a large size. Unless you already own one we recommend purchasing a different board, either the [Arduino Mega 2560 Pro Mini](../arduino-mega-2560-pro-mini) if you need a large number of pins or the [Arduino Pro Micro](../arduino-pro-micro) if space is at a premium.
