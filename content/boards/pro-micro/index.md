> [!WARNING]
> Some lower-cost Pro Micro clones, particularly those purchased from AliExpress, are
> [8MHz variants](/boards/unsupported/pro-micro-8mhz) which are not supported by MobiFlight.
> Always check the product listing carefully to ensure
> you are ordering the 16MHz version. Purchasing a Pro Micro
> [from the MobiFlight Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/arduino-pro-micro-usb-c) ensures
> you will get a board running at 16Mhz.
