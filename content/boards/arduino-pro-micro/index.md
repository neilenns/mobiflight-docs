The Arduino Pro Micro (16MHz) is a compact board that trades a smaller size for fewer IO pins than the Arduino Mega boards. It is a great choice when space is at a premium.

## Specifications

- 12 digital IO pins, 5 with PWM support.
- 9 analog inputs (can be used as digital inputs).

> [!WARNING]
> Some lower-cost Arduino Pro Micro boards, particularly those purchased from AliExpress, are 8MHz
> variants which are not supported by MobiFlight. Always check the product listing carefully to ensure
> you are ordering the 16MHz version. Purchasing an Arduino Pro Micro
> [from the MobiFlight Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/arduino-pro-micro-usb-c) ensures
> you will get a board running at 16Mhz.
