MobiFlight is an all-volunteer project. If you enjoy it, please consider donating to help support ongoing development.

Monetary donations can be made via PayPal:

{{% paypal-donate %}}

You can also support the project by [sponsoring the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/MobiFlight) and purchasing boards and hardware from the [MobiFlight shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/).

In addition to monetary donations consider supporting the project by helping new users in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yUaBqMbz). We often have users who need help with the basics of getting started and we welcome everyone who has some MobiFlight experience to jump in and assist.
