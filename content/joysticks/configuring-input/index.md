## Button, switch, encoder, and 4-way hat inputs

These inputs are configured in MobiFlight [the same way as generic button and switch devices](/devices/button-switch/configuring-input).

When selecting the **Module** and **Device**, select the appropriate joystick and switch. Alternatively, press the **Scan for input** button and toggle the input to automatically detect and select the button.

## Slider and axis inputs

Slider and axis inputs, such as throttle levers and yokes, are configured in MobiFlight [the same way as generic potentiometer devices](/devices/potentiometer/configuring-input).

When selecting the **Module** and **Device**, select the appropriate joystick and switch. Alternatively, press the **Scan for input** button and move the input to automatically detect and select the axis.
