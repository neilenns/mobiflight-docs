When building panels, you may encounter situations where you have more buttons for input than available pins on your board. Multiplexers like the [74HC4051](https://www.ti.com/product/CD74HC4051) (8-bit) and [74HC4067](https://www.ti.com/product/CD74HC4067) (16-bit) allow you to read input from 16 buttons while only using five pins on the board. Additional multiplexers connected to the same board only require one additional pin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MobiFlight only supports connecting buttons to multiplexers. Encoders must be connected directly to a board.
