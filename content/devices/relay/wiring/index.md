> [!CAUTION]
> Do not work with voltages over 24V unless you are familiar with electrical safety standards. AC mains voltage can cause serious injury or death if handled improperly. If you are unsure of how to work with AC mains voltage safely, consult a qualified electrician.

The following schematic illustrates how to wire a relay to close a main voltage circuit when a `1` output value is sent from MobiFlight. The circuit is open when a `0` output is sent.
