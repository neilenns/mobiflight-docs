MOSFETs are a popular option for controlling backlights in a cockpit build. They are a convenient way to control [dimmable COB light strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFWCD97Z) from a MobiFlight output.

To use MOSFETs with MobiFlight, follow the [LED guide](/devices/leds/) to configure them as outputs.

## Popular options

[Breakout boards](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-IRF520-MOSFET-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B01I1J14MO) with the MOSFET installed and screw terminals for 12V power are a good starting option. These typically use the IFR520 MOSFET.
