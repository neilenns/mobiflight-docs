The following schematic illustrates how to connect an IRF520 breakout board to a [12V LED light strip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFWCD97Z).

To support dimming, ensure the **SIG** pin is connected to a PWM-capable input on the board. The [boards](/boards/) page provides pinout diagrams for each board indicating the pins that support PWM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GND from the +12V power supply and the GND pin of the board must be connected together.
