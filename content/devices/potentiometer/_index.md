Potentiometers provide input values between a range when connected to an analog input on a board. They are often used for setting values like brightness, volume, flap position, elevator, rudder, trim, and throttle.

The most common potentiometers used with MobiFlight are 10kΩ linear potentiometers, which provide a useful range of motion when combined with the 0-1023 steps available on most board analog inputs. Other devices that produce a variable voltage can also be used, such as Hall effect sensors.
