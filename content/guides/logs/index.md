MobiFlight logs make it easier for people to answer support questions in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yUaBqMbz). The following steps show how to enable and share logs from MobiFlight.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always share the complete log file using these steps when requested. Sharing partial logs, or screenshots of logs,
> delays support and makes it harder to resolve questions.

### Set the log level

In many cases the default **Info** log level is sufficient for troubleshooting. If the request was for debug logging change the **Log Level** dropdown to **Debug**.

### Close settings

Click **OK** to close the dialog.

With logging is enabled, re-create the issue. Depending on the problem this may include:

- Closing and running MobiFlight.

- Interacting with devices.
- Triggering events in the the simulator.

> After the issue is resolved, disable logging by going to the **Settings** dialog and unchecking the **enabled** checkbox for **Logging**.
> Logging can slow MobiFlight down and should only be enabled when troubleshooting.
